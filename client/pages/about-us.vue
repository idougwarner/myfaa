    <div class="q-mt-md text-body">
      Mr. Sam Collins has worked in aerospace for the last 20 years which
      includes for companies such as Cessna Aircraft Company, Cirrus, Chromalloy
      in addition to other aerospace companies and what he found was
      inconsistency amongst training programs. “Training should be professional,
      easy to use by the employees, and easy to manage by the administrators”.
      He mentions how burdensome managing a training matrix, ensuring everyone
      is current, sending out training reminders and keeping up with the daily
      workload can be! With more than 13 years of experience as a Director of
      Quality for some amazing companies he wants to offer them and the rest of
      the aerospace community a better way to conduct and manage training needs.
